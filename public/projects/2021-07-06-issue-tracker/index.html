<p>The issue tracker was a bit of an ambitous project- It was my first reason project, so I had no idea how to handle things. It was also my first and currently my only ASP.Net Core project using the &quot;MVC&quot; structure. When creating this project, I had no idea how to do CSS and I was heavily depending on divs, rather than using the most appropriate elements (such as sections, articles etc).</p>
