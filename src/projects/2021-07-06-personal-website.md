<p>I started this project back at the start of June. I decided to create it after seeing countless recruiters state "We can get a much clearer image of who we are hiring when they have a personal website!". One of my biggest concerns while job searching was always "Are they getting a good image of me via my Resume alone?" so I instantly fell in love with that idea. The first question I had was: "Well, okay... how should I do this?" Prior to this, I only had made one web project- my issue tracker. I had no experience designing websites- nor did I even know of any designing tools.<aside><img class="portfolio-pull-right" src="/assets/projects/figma_design.png" alt="Figma Design"></aside>The answer was: Figma and Pinterest. <br><br> I started looking up portfolio website designs on Pinterest and noted down some ideas based on them. Afterwards, I pulled up Figma and started making some basic elements. The design didn't too long to create with the powerful tools Figma offered. <br> After I completed the design, it was time to pull up my code editor, VSCode. I also opened up YouTube to put on some music when I saw something that caught my eye. "Sass Tutorial for Beginners - CSS with Superpowers". Since I knew I'd be heavily relying on CSS, I opened it to see what it was about... Thank god I did. While I've not used the nesting since I want to get used to how CSS works as it is, I have used mixins for a few things in the project, but the greatest asset was partials.<br> Once I completed that video and armed with my new found knowledge, I created the index.html page and wrote up some markup, each section of my design getting a section element. The markup isn't all that complicated, so it doesn't need much explaining...<br><br> The most important part starts now: CSS, or rather SCSS. I created a 'src/scss' folder and then created a folder for each section ('src/scss/portfolio/') and then made seperate partials for each component in the section, which were then linked into a partial with the same name as the section ('src/scss/portfolio/_portfolio.scss'). You might ask "Isn't that a bit overkill?" and it might be... but it certainly made it very easy to read my CSS and keep track of where to make changes when I had to.<aside><img class="portfolio-pull-left" src="/assets/projects/partials.png" alt="Screenshot of partials" /></aside>Once all the partials were created and linked into a 'main.scss' in the root of the scss folder, the design was done. At that point, I started writing... well, this. I started filling out the details of the projects. After I finish doing that, I'll likely make a backup, as I recently saw another video about 'templating languages'. That will be incredibly helpful for adding new projects to this website in the future, as current I have to manually add them...<p>
